=========================================
TEST WORKFLOW
=========================================

Analyze the following Jest test report, identifying root causes for failures and suggesting specific code fixes. Focus on component rendering, data processing, and integration issues. Provide actionable insights for improving test coverage and stability.

Test Report Input:
@/jest-failure-report.log / User Chat Input

Desired Output:

A structured analysis of the test report, including:

1. Categorization of Failures:

   - Group failures by component, integration, or utility function.

2. Root Cause Analysis:

   - Identify the underlying reasons for each failure, referencing specific error messages and code snippets.

3. Suggested Code Fixes:

   - Provide concrete code changes to address the identified root causes.

4. Test Coverage Improvements:

   - Suggest new tests or modifications to existing tests to improve coverage and prevent future regressions.

5. Performance Considerations:

   - Note any tests with unusually long durations and suggest potential optimizations.

6. Prioritization:

   - Rank the failures by severity and impact, guiding developers on which issues to address first.

7. Specific Questions:

   - Pose targeted questions to the development team to clarify ambiguous error messages or gather additional context.

8. Environment Details:
   - Assume a React/Next.js environment with Jest and Testing Library for testing.
