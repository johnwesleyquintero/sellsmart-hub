**AI Task: Codebase Scan and Project Tracker Update**

**Objective:**
Scan the codebase to identify issues, optimize performance, and update the `PROJECT_TRACKER.md` file with detailed findings and actionable recommendations.

**Instructions:**

1. **Initial Scan:**

   - Perform an initial scan of the entire codebase.
   - Identify potential issues, outdated dependencies, and areas for optimization.
   - Flag potential issues and suggest areas for further investigation.

2. **Review and Analyze:**

   - Review `PROJECT_TRACKER.md` for existing errors, warnings, and pending tasks.
   - Identify root causes of issues and prioritize tasks based on severity and impact.
   - Categorize and prioritize issues, providing insights and suggestions for resolution.

3. **Dependency Check:**

   - Review all dependencies, including version numbers, and evaluate their impact.
   - Suggest updates and identify potential conflicts or vulnerabilities.

4. **Code Quality Analysis:**

   - Run `npm run cq` to analyze code quality.
   - Identify code quality issues, including maintainability, readability, performance, and security concerns.
   - Provide detailed feedback on code quality issues and suggest improvements.

5. **Implement Fixes:**

   - Address issues systematically based on log analysis and prioritized tasks.
   - Generate code suggestions, identify potential bugs, and optimize code snippets.
   - Ensure each fix is thoroughly tested to maintain functionality and stability.

6. **Security Audit:**

   - Conduct a security audit to identify vulnerabilities.
   - Highlight potential security risks and suggest mitigation strategies.

7. **Performance Optimization:**

   - Analyze the codebase for performance bottlenecks.
   - Identify performance issues and suggest optimizations.

8. **Documentation Update:**

   - Update `PROJECT_TRACKER.md` to reflect the current state of the codebase.
   - Ensure the documentation includes:
     - New features with clear explanations.
     - Resolved issues with summaries.
     - Known bugs, including severity and workarounds.
     - Updated usage instructions and configuration changes.
     - Performance considerations and optimization suggestions.
   - Automatically generate documentation drafts and suggest improvements.

9. **Verify Changes:**

   - Run `npm run cq` again to verify that all issues have been resolved.
   - Provide a final report on the status of the codebase and any remaining issues.

10. **Continuous Monitoring:**

    - Set up automated scans and alerts for ongoing codebase monitoring.
    - Provide regular updates and alerts on potential issues.

11. **Review and Feedback:**
    - Summarize feedback and suggest further improvements based on team reviews.

**Output:**

- A comprehensive update to `PROJECT_TRACKER.md` with detailed findings, actionable recommendations, and optimizations.
- A final report summarizing the changes made and any remaining issues.
