**HIGH PRIORITY (Implement/Fix ASAP)**
---

1.  **Implement Missing Core Tools:**
    *   Develop and integrate the "Product Score Calculation" tool. (Marked as 'under development and not yet available')
        *   Implementation Plan: IMPLEMENTATION_ProductScoreCalc.md
    *   Develop and integrate the "Optimal Price Calculation" tool. (Marked as 'under development and not yet available')
        *   Implementation Plan: IMPLEMENTATION_OptimalPriceCalc.md

2.  **Fix ACoS Calculator Bugs:**
    *   Address the CSV parsing errors, especially for malformed data. Implement robust validation and user feedback for CSV uploads. (Marked as 'Known Bugs')
    *   Investigate and resolve discrepancies in real-time performance metrics due to potential data synchronization issues. (Marked as 'Known Bugs')
    *   Implementation Plan: IMPLEMENTATION_AcosCalcFix.md

3.  **Resolve PPC Campaign Auditor Status & Stability:**
    *   Clarify the actual status (Beta v0.9.0 vs. Active v2.0.0).
    *   If Beta, prioritize completing development, testing, and stabilization for a production-ready release (v2.0.0). Address any outstanding issues preventing it from being fully "Active".
    *   Implementation Plan: IMPLEMENTATION_PpcAuditorStabilization.md

**MEDIUM PRIORITY (Important Enhancements & Validation)**
---

4.  **Enhance ACoS Calculator Robustness & Clarity:**
    *   Improve handling of CSV format variations and provide clearer user guidance/documentation on expected formats. (Related to 'Limitations')
    *   Review and potentially refine the predictive analysis accuracy. Document factors influencing prediction quality. (Related to 'Limitations')
    *   Investigate behavior with low-spend campaigns and document or improve handling if necessary. (Related to 'Limitations')

5.  **Validate and Refine AI/Smart Features:**
    *   Review the implementation, performance, and effectiveness of "AI-powered" / "Smart" features in:
        *   Listing Quality Checker (Title/Description/Bullet optimization, SEO recommendations)
        *   Description Editor (SEO optimization, Automated score calculation)
        *   Keyword Deduplicator (Duplicate detection, suggestions)
    *   Ensure these features are fully functional, reliable, and provide tangible value.

---
**LOW PRIORITY (Maintenance & Documentation)**
---

6.  **Documentation Update:**
    *   After addressing higher priority items, update `amazon-seller-tools.mdx` and any other relevant documentation to accurately reflect the current status, features, versions, resolved bugs, and known limitations of *all* tools. Ensure consistency between the table and detailed descriptions.

7.  **Code Review & Refactoring:**
    *   Conduct periodic code reviews across the components to ensure consistency, maintainability, and adherence to best practices (React, TypeScript, shadcn/ui usage).
