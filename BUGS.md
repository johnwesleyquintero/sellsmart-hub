### Implement all the remaining task fixes for the potential bugs and suggested remediation strategies.

**Summary of Potential Bugs:**

- **acos-calculator.tsx:** ✅ Fixed
  - ~~Error Handling: Error messages are displayed to the user without any logging or reporting.~~ (Implemented centralized error handling)
  - ~~Input Sanitization: The component does not prevent the user from entering very large numbers, which could lead to performance issues or unexpected behavior.~~ (Added input validation)
  - ~~State Management: If the component is unmounted while a CSV file is being parsed, the state update could cause a memory leak.~~ (Fixed cleanup on unmount)
  - ~~Calculation of metrics: The `calculateLocalMetrics` function does not handle cases where `impressions` or `clicks` are zero, which could lead to division by zero errors.~~ (Added zero-value handling)
- **CampaignCard.tsx:** ✅ Fixed
  - ~~Potential Null Pointer Dereference: The component uses optional chaining (`?.`) when accessing properties, which could mask underlying issues in the data.~~ (Added proper type checking)
  - ~~Inconsistent Data Types: The `CampaignData` interface is not defined in this file.~~ (Added interface definition)
  - ~~Lack of Error Handling: The component does not handle any errors that might occur during rendering.~~ (Implemented error boundary)
- **competitor-analyzer.tsx:** ✅ Fixed
  - ~~Local Storage Usage: The component saves analysis results to local storage, which has limited capacity.~~ (Implemented data pagination and cleanup)
  - ~~Error Handling in `fetchAndProcessApiData`: The function does not handle cases where the API returns invalid data.~~ (Added comprehensive error handling)
  - ~~Potential XSS Vulnerability: The component displays data from the API in the chart without sanitization.~~ (Implemented DOMPurify)
  - ~~Inconsistent State Updates: The `processCsvData` function updates the `chartData` state without handling cases where the data is invalid or missing.~~ (Added data validation)

**Suggested Remediation Strategies:**

1.  **Implement Proper Error Handling:** Add logging and reporting to all components to track errors in production. Use a centralized error logging service to collect and analyze errors.
2.  **Add Input Validation:** Implement comprehensive input validation to prevent users from entering invalid data. Use regular expressions to validate the format of strings, and check the range of numeric values.
3.  **Replace Mock Implementations:** Replace the mock implementations for keyword analysis, ASIN checks, and data processing with real implementations that call external APIs or use local machine learning models.
4.  **Improve Scoring Logic:** Review and improve the scoring logic to ensure that it accurately reflects the quality of a listing or campaign. Consider using a more sophisticated scoring algorithm that takes into account more factors.
5.  **Allow User Customization:** Allow users to customize the weights, thresholds, and other parameters used by the components. This will make the components more flexible and adaptable to different products and categories.
6.  **Improve Data Type Handling:** Use more specific data types to improve type safety and prevent unexpected behavior.
7.  **Sanitize Input Data:** Sanitize user-provided data to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
8.  **Implement Export Functionality:** Implement the export functionality in all components that generate data.
9.  **Implement CSV Parsing:** Use a robust CSV parsing library like Papa Parse to handle CSV file uploads.
10. **Address the `handleCsvParse` function in `CsvUploader.tsx`:** Implement the function to properly parse the CSV file and pass the data to the `onUploadSuccess` callback.
