# Mastering Amazon PPC

## Understanding Amazon PPC Fundamentals

Amazon Pay-Per-Click (PPC) advertising is a powerful tool for increasing product visibility and sales. With Amazon PPC, you only pay when a shopper clicks on your ad, making it a cost-effective way to drive targeted traffic to your listings.

### The Three Main Ad Types

1. **Sponsored Products**: These ads appear in search results and on product detail pages, promoting individual product listings.
2. **Sponsored Brands**: These ads feature your brand logo, a custom headline, and multiple products, appearing at the top of search results.
3. **Sponsored Display**: These ads appear both on and off Amazon, targeting shoppers based on interests or behaviors.

## Campaign Structure Best Practices

A well-organized campaign structure is essential for effective management and optimization:

### The 3-Tier Campaign Structure

1. **Portfolio Level**: Group related campaigns together for easier management and budget allocation
2. **Campaign Level**: Focus on specific targeting strategies (automatic vs manual)
3. **Ad Group Level**: Organize by product similarity and keyword relevance
