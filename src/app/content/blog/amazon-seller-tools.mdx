## üìà Roadmap & Future Updates

Our team is actively working on addressing the high-priority bugs and stabilization tasks outlined in `PROJECT_TRACKER.md`, particularly for the PPC Campaign Auditor. We are also focused on completing the development of the Optimal Price Calculation tool and enhancing its AI features. The `check-quality.cjs` script has been enhanced with parallel execution, module system consistency, and basic config validation to improve code quality and efficiency.

The API key management system has been updated to include input validation, prevent race conditions, and implement rate limiting.

This documentation will be updated periodically as significant changes, fixes, or new features are released. Thank you for your understanding as we continue to improve the Amazon Seller Tools Suite!
