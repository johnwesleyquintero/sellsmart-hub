## FAQs: Common Questions

### Reporting & Analysis Expertise

**Q: How do you approach reporting and analysis for Amazon sellers?**

My approach is data-driven and focused on actionable insights. I leverage:

Direct SP-API Integration: To pull raw, granular data beyond standard Seller Central reports, feeding into custom systems like the Amazon Portfolio Platform.
Custom-Built Dashboards: Like the 'Custom Amazon Analytics Dashboard' I developed, providing real-time tracking of sales, inventory, and competitive metrics tailored to specific client needs.
Automated Tools: Utilizing tools I've built, such as the 'PPC Campaign Auditor' and 'ACoS Calculator', to process large datasets quickly and identify trends or anomalies in performance (e.g., profitability, ad spend efficiency).
Cross-Functional Analysis: Connecting data points across sales, advertising (PPC), inventory (FBA), and listing quality to get a holistic view of account health and identify growth opportunities.
Focus on Key KPIs: Tracking metrics like Total Sales, Ad Spend, ACoS, TACOS, Conversion Rates, Inventory Performance Index (IPI), and Buy Box Percentage, but always linking them back to overall profitability and strategic goals.

**Q: What are the most critical reports or data points you focus on for Amazon success?**

While it depends on the specific goal, the critical areas are usually:

Profitability: Analyzing unit session percentage, ACoS/TACOS, and margin calculations (often requiring custom data pulls via SP-API beyond basic reports). My 'Optimal Price Calculation Tool' assists here.
Advertising Performance: Deep dives into Search Term Reports, Campaign Performance Reports (using tools like my 'PPC Campaign Auditor' for efficiency), and Placement Reports to optimize ad spend.
Inventory Health: Monitoring IPI, sell-through rate, aged inventory, and estimated lost sales using Inventory Reports to avoid stockouts and storage fees. My FBA inventory management automation work addresses this directly.
Sales & Traffic: Tracking Business Reports for page views, sessions, conversion rates by ASIN to understand customer behavior and listing effectiveness.
Listing Quality: While not a standard 'report', analyzing listing data (title, bullets, description, images) against performance metrics, often using custom tools like the 'Listing Quality Checker' I developed.

**Q: Can you give an example of an insight you derived from reporting that led to a significant business improvement?**

Situation: A client using our platform saw increasing Ad Spend but stagnant Total Sales (rising TACOS). Task: Analyze their PPC and Sales data to identify the root cause and recommend corrective actions. Action: - Used the 'PPC Campaign Auditor' tool I built to quickly identify campaigns with high spend and low conversion rates. - Cross-referenced with Search Term Reports pulled via SP-API, revealing significant wasted spend on irrelevant keywords. - Analyzed Business Reports, showing declining conversion rates on key ASINs despite traffic. - Used the 'Listing Quality Checker' to identify potential optimization issues on those specific ASINs. Result: Recommended pausing wasteful campaigns/keywords, reallocating budget to high-performing ones, and optimizing the underperforming listings. This led to a 15% reduction in ACoS and a 10% increase in overall conversion rate within a month, directly improving profitability for their $1M+ monthly operation.

**Q: What tools do you use for generating and analyzing Amazon reports?**

Amazon Seller Central: For standard Business Reports, Advertising Reports, Inventory Reports, etc.
Amazon SP-API: Extensively used for custom data extraction, automation, and feeding data into bespoke systems. This is core to my expertise.
Custom Developed Tools: Leveraging the suite I built (Analytics Dashboard, PPC Auditor, ACoS Calculator, etc.) for specialized analysis and automation. These are often built with React/Next.js frontends and Python/Node.js backends using AWS Lambda.
Database & Analysis Tools: Utilizing MongoDB/PostgreSQL for storing aggregated data and potentially Python (Pandas) for complex offline analysis when needed.
Visualization: Implementing data visualization directly within the custom dashboards using libraries compatible with React/Next.js.
