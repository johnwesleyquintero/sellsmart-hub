**Handling Conflict:**

- **S:** Disagreed with a stakeholder's request to add a complex, rarely used feature to the Custom Analytics Dashboard, concerned it would delay core functionality delivery.
- **T:** Needed to address the stakeholder's perceived need while keeping the project on track.
- **A:** Presented data showing the limited user segment that would benefit vs. the development effort required. Proposed a phased approach: deliver core features first, then re-evaluate the complex feature based on actual usage data and feedback post-launch. Showcased a simpler alternative that met 80% of their need with 20% of the effort.
- **R:** Stakeholder agreed to the phased approach. We delivered the core dashboard on time, and later data confirmed the complex feature wasn't a high priority for most users. Maintained a positive working relationship by focusing on data and compromise.

**Learning from Mistakes:**

- **S:** Early version of the Automated Listing Management System had an intermittent bug causing incorrect inventory levels to sync under specific race conditions during simultaneous updates.
- **T:** Needed to quickly identify the root cause, fix the bug, and prevent recurrence, as inventory accuracy is critical.
- **A:** Implemented detailed logging around the sync process. Reproduced the race condition in a test environment. Identified the flaw in the update logic. Refactored the code to use atomic database operations (or locking mechanisms). Added specific integration tests covering concurrent update scenarios.
- **R:** Deployed the fix, resolving the intermittent errors. The added tests now prevent regressions. Documented the issue and resolution in our internal knowledge base (Notion/Confluence) as a learning point for handling concurrency.

**Taking Initiative:**

- **S:** While managing PPC campaigns manually for a client, I noticed significant time spent repeatedly analyzing Search Term Reports for negative keywords across dozens of campaigns.
- **T:** Realized this repetitive task was inefficient and prone to human error, representing an opportunity for automation.
- **A:** Prototyped a script (Python) using SP-API data to automatically flag potential negative keywords based on configurable rules (spend, clicks, conversions, relevance). Presented the prototype and potential time savings to my manager/client. Gained approval to develop it into a more robust tool (part of the eventual PPC Campaign Auditor).
- **R:** The tool significantly reduced manual analysis time (by ~70% for that specific task), improved the consistency of negative keyword implementation, and freed up time for more strategic PPC optimization.
