  - **Impact:** Critical security vulnerability allowing for sandbox escape.
  - **Affected Package:** `vm2`
  - **Recommendation:** Investigate updating the affected packages to the latest versions.

## Actions Taken

- Ran `npm audit fix` and `npm audit`. Both commands failed to fully resolve the vulnerabilities.
- Attempted to update individual packages, but the vulnerabilities persisted.
- Attempted to update all dependencies using `npm update`, but this failed due to an EBUSY error.
- Ran `npm audit fix --force`, which addressed many vulnerabilities but introduced breaking changes.

## Next Steps

- Carefully review the dependencies and their versions.
- Attempt to update the affected packages to the latest versions, testing the application after each update to ensure compatibility.
- If updating packages does not resolve the vulnerabilities, consider alternative mitigation strategies, such as:
  - Using a different package that provides similar functionality.
  - Implementing workarounds to mitigate the vulnerabilities.
  - If necessary, and after careful consideration of the risks, use `npm audit fix --force`.

## Conclusion

This report highlights the vulnerabilities present in the project's dependencies. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial for maintaining the security and stability of the application. The recommendations and next steps outlined in this document should be followed to mitigate the identified risks.
