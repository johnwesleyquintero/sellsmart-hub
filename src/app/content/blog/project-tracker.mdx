## ERROR HANDLING STANDARDIZATION DETAILS

_(Documentation of implemented error handling strategy)_

### New Features

- **ErrorBoundary Component:** Shared component (`src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`) wrapping critical sections for graceful error handling and fallback UI.
- **Standardized API Error Response Format:** Using `ApiError` class (`src/lib/api/error-handler.ts`) for consistent API error reporting.
- **Consistent Error Logging Patterns:** Using `logger` utility (`src/lib/api/logger.ts`) for detailed error logging (URL, method, error object).

### Resolved Issues

- Inconsistent error handling across components.
- Lack of a standardized approach for API failures.
- Missing error boundaries in critical components.

### Known Bugs

- **Severity:** Medium - `ErrorBoundary` may not catch errors during server-side rendering in some cases. (Workaround: Page refresh).

### Usage Instructions

- Wrap critical components with `<ErrorBoundary>...</ErrorBoundary>`.
- Use `ApiError` class for standard API error responses.
- Use `logger` utility for consistent error logging.

### Configuration Changes

- `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable controls logging verbosity.

---

## REDIS AND CACHE MANAGEMENT DETAILS

_(Documentation of implemented Redis/Cache strategy)_

### Redis Connection Resilience

- **Retry Mechanisms:** Implemented exponential backoff for temporary connection failures (max retries, delay configured).
- **Error Handling:** Added comprehensive logging and graceful handling for Redis connection errors.

### Cache Invalidation Strategy

- **cacheKeyPrefix:** Introduced a prefix (`v1`, configurable via `CACHE_KEY_PREFIX` env var) prepended to keys for broad cache invalidation by changing the prefix.
- **invalidateCache Function:** Implemented function (`invalidateCache(key)`) for programmatic, targeted cache invalidation (`redis.del`).

### Cache Performance Monitoring

- **Metrics Tracked:** Cache hit rate, miss rate, average retrieval time.
- **Metrics Exposure:** Exposed via `monitoring` utility (`src/lib/monitoring.ts`) at `/api/monitoring` endpoint.

### Resolved Issues

- Improved Redis connection error handling.
- Reviewed and implemented initial cache management strategy.

### Identified Bottlenecks (Addressed by tasks in "Performance & Optimization")

- Current `CacheStore` uses an in-memory `Map` (not shared/persistent).
- Current invalidation (`cacheKeyPrefix`) is broad; granular control needed.
- Cache pruning interval is fixed (1 min); needs configuration.
- JSON serialization can be slow for large objects.

### Usage Instructions

- Use `cacheKeyPrefix` (via env var) for broad invalidation if needed.
- Use `invalidateCache(key)` for targeted invalidation.
- Monitor performance via `/api/monitoring`.

### Configuration Changes

- `REDIS_URL` environment variable must be set.
- `CACHE_KEY_PREFIX` environment variable can configure the cache prefix.

## ERROR LOG ANALYSIS

### no-undef
- **Frequency:** 3
- **Errors:**
  - `'setKeywords' is not defined` (line 3)
  - `'console' is not defined` (line 14)
  - `'console' is not defined` (line 15)
- **Suggested Solutions:**
  - For `console` errors, use `console.log` within a browser context or ensure the code is not running in a browser-less environment.
  - For `setKeywords` undefined error, investigate where this function should be defined and ensure it is imported or defined correctly.

### @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars
- **Frequency:** 3
- **Errors:**
  - `'setKeywords' is assigned a value but never used` (line 4)
  - `'keywordData' is assigned a value but never used` (line 5)
  - `'e' is defined but never used` (line 6)
- **Suggested Solutions:**
  - Remove the unused variables or use them appropriately.

### @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any
- **Frequency:** 7
- **Errors:**
  - `Unexpected any. Specify a different type` (lines 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13)
- **Suggested Solutions:**
  - Replace `any` with more specific types.
