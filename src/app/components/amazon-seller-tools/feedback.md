## Key areas for improvement in the Amazon Seller Tools suite:

**_I've analyzed the current Amazon Seller Tools components and identified several key areas for improvement:_**

**_Important Note: Refactor the codebase to consolidate UI components, eliminating redundancy. Implement the refactoring within a "components\ui" and "lib" directory. Prioritize removing duplicated UI, component, and utility files._**

1.  **Duplicate UI Components:** Identify and remove redundant UI components from the "components\ui" directory.
2.  **Duplicate Utility Files:** Identify and remove duplicated utility files from the "lib" directory.
3.  **Unused UI Components:** Review and remove unused UI components that are no longer required or used.
4.  **Unused Utility Functions:** Review and remove unused utility functions that are no longer required or used.
5.  **Improve Code Readability:** Refactor the codebase to improve readability and maintainability.

**Redesign and refactor the entire Amazon Seller Tools suite, focusing on a modern, intuitive, and data-driven user experience. This includes:**

1.  **Enhanced Data Visualization:** Integrate interactive, dynamic charts and graphs within each tool to facilitate in-depth data analysis and reporting. Charts should support drill-down capabilities, customizable views, and real-time data updates.
2.  **Robust Data Export:** Implement comprehensive data export functionality across all tools, supporting a wide range of file formats (e.g., CSV, Excel, PDF, JSON) with customizable export options (e.g., date ranges, specific data fields).
3.  **Intuitive Navigation & Information Architecture:** Redesign the navigation structure for improved discoverability and ease of use. Implement a clear and consistent information architecture across all tools.
4.  **Responsive Design & Accessibility:** Ensure a fully responsive design that adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices. Adhere to WCAG guidelines for accessibility compliance, ensuring usability for all users.
5.  **Code Refactoring & Reusability:** Refactor the codebase for improved maintainability and scalability. Identify and implement reusable UI components and utility functions to eliminate code duplication and promote consistency.
6.  **Duplication Elimination & UI Enhancement:** Identify and remove redundant code and UI elements. Enhance existing UI elements for improved visual appeal, clarity, and user interaction.

**Next steps would be to implement these improvements systematically across all tools while maintaining existing functionality.**
