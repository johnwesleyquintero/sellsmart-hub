   - Identify root causes of issues.

2. IMPLEMENT FIXES:

   - Address issues systematically based on log analysis.
   - Test each fix to maintain functionality.

3. VERIFY:

   - Run `npm run cq` to check fixes.
   - Identify any remaining issues.

4. ITERATE:

   - Repeat steps until all quality checks pass.

5. BUILD:

   - Run `npm run build` for production deployment.
   - Ensure build completes successfully.

6. DOCUMENTATION UPDATE:

   - Citically analyze the codebase, specifically focusing on the current functionality, limitations, and dependencies of Amazon Seller Tools.
   - Based on this analysis, comprehensively update the blog documentation located at `src\app\content\blog\amazon-seller-tools.mdx` and `PROJECT_TRACKER.md` to accurately reflect the present status of these tools.
   - Ensure the updated documentation includes clear explanations of new features, resolved issues, known bugs, and any changes to usage instructions or configuration.
   - Prioritize clarity, accuracy, and completeness to provide users with a reliable and up-to-date resource.

   - Codebase to review:
     - `src`
     - `src\app\content\blog\amazon-seller-tools.mdx`
     - `PROJECT_TRACKER.md`
