          lead to clear actions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Leverage SP-API:</strong> Prioritize direct API integration
          for granular, real-time data unavailable in standard reports, feeding
          custom tools (like my Portfolio Platform).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Proficient with CSV Reports:</strong> Fully capable of
          analyzing standard Seller Central downloads (Business, Ads, Inventory)

        <li>
          <strong>Custom Dashboards:</strong> Build tailored views (using
          React/Next.js or tools like Looker Studio/Google Sheets) visualizing
          KPIs critical to the client’s goals (e.g., TACOS trends, inventory
          velocity).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Automation Tools:</strong> Utilize custom-built tools (PPC
          Auditor, ACoS Calculator) to efficiently process large datasets from
          API or CSVs, identifying performance trends and anomalies.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Holistic View:</strong> Connect data across Sales,
          Advertising, Inventory, and Listing Quality to understand the full
          picture and identify cross-functional opportunities.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>KPI Focus:</strong> Track key metrics (Sales, Ad Spend, ACoS,

      <p><strong>Teamwork/Collaboration:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>S:</strong> Developing the Amazon Portfolio Platform required
          coordinating frontend (React), backend (Node.js/Python), and data
          analysis efforts across a small, remote team.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>T:</strong> Needed to integrate the PPC analysis module with
          the main data aggregation pipeline being built by another developer.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>A:</strong> Used Jira for task tracking, held regular brief
          sync calls via Slack Huddles/Zoom, clearly defined API contracts
          between our modules, and conducted peer code reviews via GitHub Pull
          Requests.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>R:</strong> Successfully integrated modules on schedule,
          resulting in a cohesive platform. Clear communication prevented
          integration issues and fostered a collaborative environment despite
          being remote.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Handling Conflict:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>S:</strong> Disagreed with a stakeholder’s request to add a
          complex, rarely used feature to the Custom Analytics Dashboard,
          concerned it would delay core functionality delivery.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>T:</strong> Needed to address the stakeholder’s perceived need
          while keeping the project on track.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>A:</strong> Presented data showing the limited user segment
          that would benefit vs. the development effort required. Proposed a
          phased approach: deliver core features first, then re-evaluate the
          complex feature based on actual usage data and feedback post-launch.
          Showcased a simpler alternative that met 80% of their need with 20% of
          the effort.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>R:</strong> Stakeholder agreed to the phased approach. We
          delivered the core dashboard on time, and later data confirmed the
          complex feature wasn’t a high priority for most users. Maintained a
          positive working relationship by focusing on data and compromise.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Learning from Mistakes:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>S:</strong> Early version of the Automated Listing Management
          System had an intermittent bug causing incorrect inventory levels to
          sync under specific race conditions during simultaneous updates.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>T:</strong> Needed to quickly identify the root cause, fix the
          bug, and prevent recurrence, as inventory accuracy is critical.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>A:</strong> Implemented detailed logging around the sync
          process. Reproduced the race condition in a test environment.
          Identified the flaw in the update logic. Refactored the code to use
          atomic database operations (or locking mechanisms). Added specific
          integration tests covering concurrent update scenarios.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>R:</strong> Deployed the fix, resolving the intermittent
          errors. The added tests now prevent regressions. Documented the issue
          and resolution in our internal knowledge base (Notion/Confluence) as a
          learning point for handling concurrency.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Taking Initiative:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>S:</strong> While managing PPC campaigns manually for a
          client, I noticed significant time spent repeatedly analyzing Search
          Term Reports for negative keywords across dozens of campaigns.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>T:</strong> Realized this repetitive task was inefficient and
          prone to human error, representing an opportunity for automation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>A:</strong> Prototyped a script (Python) using SP-API data to
          automatically flag potential negative keywords based on configurable
          rules (spend, clicks, conversions, relevance). Presented the prototype
          and potential time savings to my manager/client. Gained approval to
          develop it into a more robust tool (part of the eventual PPC Campaign
          Auditor).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>R:</strong> The tool significantly reduced manual analysis
          time (by ~70% for that specific task), improved the consistency of
          negative keyword implementation, and freed up time for more strategic
          PPC optimization.
        </li>
      </ul>
