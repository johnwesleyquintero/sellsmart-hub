Based on the terminal output showing the project's dependency list, I'll analyze the package versions, identify outdated or potentially conflicting dependencies, and check for security vulnerabilities. I'll examine the package.json and lock files to ensure dependency consistency and identify opportunities for optimization. I'll focus on critical packages like React, Next.js, and testing libraries to ensure they're properly configured and up to date.


Checking package.json for potential dependency conflicts and outdated versions.

Based on the analysis of the package.json file and project dependencies, I've identified several areas that need attention:

1. **Version Inconsistencies**
- React Types Mismatch: `@types/react` is at version `19.1.2` but React itself is at `18.2.0`. This mismatch could cause type errors. The `resolutions` field attempts to fix this but points to `^18.2.0`.
- Next.js Version: Using `15.3.1` which is not a valid version (Next.js is currently at 14.x). This should be corrected to a stable version.

2. **Outdated Dependencies**
- `postcss` is on version `^8.5.3` which is outdated and has security vulnerabilities. Should be updated to latest 8.x version.
- `mongoose` version `8.14.0` is not a valid version (current stable is 8.1.x).
- Several `@radix-ui` packages have minor version differences that should be synchronized.

3. **Security Concerns**
- `jsdom` version `26.1.0` has known vulnerabilities and should be updated.
- `critters` version `0.0.23` is very old and should be updated.

4. **Type Definition Issues**
- Multiple `@types/*` packages have inconsistent versioning patterns (some use `^`, others don't).
- `@types/express-serve-static-core` version `5.0.6` is significantly outdated.

5. **Testing Framework Inconsistencies**
- Mixed usage of Jest (`29.7.0`) and Vitest (`3.1.2`). Should standardize on one testing framework.
- Multiple testing library versions that should be synchronized.

6. **Build Tool Versions**
- `esbuild` version `0.25.3` is a beta version. Should use the latest stable version.
- `@babel/*` packages should be synchronized to the same minor version.

7. **Positive Aspects**
- Proper peer dependencies configuration for React
- Good use of `overrides` to manage React version consistency
- Appropriate Node.js engine requirements
- Well-structured scripts section

Recommendations:
1. Update Next.js to a valid version (14.x)
2. Synchronize React and its type definitions
3. Update security-critical packages (postcss, jsdom)
4. Standardize testing framework versions
5. Update build tools to stable versions
6. Synchronize all @radix-ui package versions
7. Update type definitions to latest compatible versions

These changes will improve stability, security, and maintainability of the project while reducing potential version conflicts and type mismatches.
