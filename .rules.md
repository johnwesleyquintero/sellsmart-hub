## 1. Introduction & Project Vision

### 1.1. Purpose

This document outlines the development standards, guidelines, project structure, and operational procedures for the Wesley Quintero Portfolio project, now evolving into the **`ScaleWithWesley`** personal brand platform. Adherence to these guidelines ensures quality, consistency, and efficient development.

### 1.2. Project Goal

To develop and maintain a modern, responsive portfolio website under the **`ScaleWithWesley`** brand, showcasing technical skills, projects, and professional experience, featuring a sophisticated suite of data-driven Amazon Seller Tools as its core offering.

### 1.3. Strategic Objective

Establish **`ScaleWithWesley`** as a trusted resource for Amazon sellers and brand managers by providing advanced, reliable algorithmic utilities that streamline workflows and adhere to Amazon's standards. The aim is to reduce reliance on manual data analysis, deliver robust, exportable insights, and position the platform as a valuable hub for expertise and tools, supporting the personal brand.

## 2. Development Environment & Setup

### 2.1. Package Manager

This project utilizes **pnpm** as the primary package manager.

- **Installation:** Ensure pnpm (latest stable version recommended) is installed globally (`pnpm install -g pnpm`) or available in your environment.
- **Dependency Management:** Use `pnpm install`, `pnpm add <package>`, `pnpm remove <package>`.
- **Lockfile:** Commit the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file to version control to ensure deterministic installs across all environments. **This is the single source of truth for dependencies.**
- **Consistency:** **All project documentation (`README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, etc.) must reflect the use of `pnpm`.** (Action Item: Update other docs).

### 2.2. Environment Variables

- Configure local environment variables by copying `.env.example` to `.env`.
- **Never commit `.env` files containing sensitive credentials.**
- Use `pnpm run env:pull` (if configured) to sync environment variables from a secure source like Vercel.

### 2.3. pnpm Configuration Quality Checks (`cq` script)

Run quality checks (`pnpm run cq`) periodically or in CI pipelines to:

- Verify pnpm version compatibility.
- Ensure the integrity of `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
- Validate that `package.json` scripts are compatible with pnpm.
- Check pnpm's module resolution behavior.

## 3. Project Structure

The project follows a standard Next.js 14 App Router structure, organized for clarity and maintainability.

### 3.1. Directory Structure (Key Directories)

- `app/`: Main application code (routing, pages, layouts).
  - `(pages)/`: Route groups for distinct sections (e.g., `(portfolio)`, `(blog)`, `(tools)`).
  - `api/`: API Route Handlers (e.g., for newsletter signup).
- `components/`: Reusable UI components.
  - `ui/`: Base components (likely from shadcn/ui).
  - `shared/`: Components shared across multiple features.
  - `feature/`: Components specific to a feature (e.g., `feature/blog`, `feature/tools/acos-calculator`).
- `content/`: Blog posts and potentially other MDX content.
- `lib/`: Utility functions, helpers, constants, type definitions, hooks.
- `public/`: Static assets (images, fonts, favicon).
- `styles/`: Global styles, Tailwind configuration.
- `types/`: Shared TypeScript type definitions (if not co-located or in `lib`).
- `pnpm-lock.yaml`: **The** dependency lockfile.
- `package.json`: Project configuration and dependencies.

### 3.2. File Naming Conventions

- **Component Files:** PascalCase (e.g., `UserProfile.tsx`). Use `.tsx`.
- **Other TS/JS Files:** kebab-case (e.g., `api-helpers.ts`, `calculate-acos.ts`). Use `.ts`.
- **Style Files:** kebab-case (e.g., `global.css`).
- **Content Files:** kebab-case (e.g., `my-first-post.mdx`).

### 3.3. Code Organization

- **Modularity & Reusability:** Prioritize creating small, focused, and reusable components and functions.
- **Co-location:** Keep closely related code together (e.g., component, its styles, its types, its tests).
- **Separation of Concerns:** Clearly separate UI, data fetching, business logic, and utility functions.
- **TypeScript:** Use TypeScript strictly. Define clear interfaces and types. Leverage utility types.

## 4. Development Workflow & Priorities

### 4.1. Version Control (Git)

- **Branching:** Follow GitHub Flow. Create feature branches from `main` (e.g., `feat/setup-newsletter`, `fix/tool-validation`, `refactor/blog-layout`).
- **Commits:**
  - Keep commits small, atomic, and focused.
  - Use Conventional Commit messages (`type(scope): description`). See Section 4.2.
  - Ensure commits pass all pre-commit hooks or CI checks (`pnpm run check:all`).
- **Pull Requests (PRs):**
  - Rebase feature branches onto the latest `main` before creating a PR.
  - Fill out the PR template thoroughly. Link to relevant `TODO.md` IDs.
  - Ensure all CI checks pass.
  - Request reviews. Address feedback constructively.
  - Squash commits before merging for a cleaner history.
  - Delete branches after merging.

### 4.2. Git Commit Message Guidelines

**Format:** `type(scope): description`

**Common Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `perf`, `style`, `docs`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`

**Project Scopes (Examples):**

- `core`: Core application logic, Next.js setup
- `brand`: Branding elements (logo, theme, domain setup)
- `blog`: Blog system, MDX content, related components
- `newsletter`: Newsletter signup form, API, platform integration
- `tools`: General Amazon Seller Tools suite
- `tools-acos`: Specific ACoS Calculator tool
- `tools-ppc`: Specific PPC Auditor tool (etc. for other tools)
- `ui`: Shared UI components, styling, themes
- `lib`: Utility functions, hooks, types
- `deps`: Dependency updates
- `config`: Configuration files
- `docs`: Documentation files (`README`, `.rules.md`, etc.)
- `content`: Adding or updating blog posts/MDX content

**Breaking Changes:** Append `!` after the scope (e.g., `refactor(api)!: ...`) and include a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.

### 4.3. Current Priorities & Initiatives (Aligning with `NEW IDEA.MD`)

**Phase 0: Foundational Fixes (Prerequisites - Execute FIRST)**

1.  **Resolve Package Manager Inconsistency:** Ensure `pnpm` is consistently documented and used everywhere (`.rules.md`, `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`). (This document updated, others pending).
2.  **Align `README.md` Tool Status:** Update the `README.md` "Tools Documentation" table to accurately reflect the *actual* status based on `TODO.md`.
3.  **Execute Critical Code Cleanup:** Address `TODO.md` IDs 26 (Consolidate UI), 27 (Remove unused utils), 30 (Improve tool readability).

**Phase 1: Core Branding & Foundational Content (Execute alongside/after Phase 0)**

1.  **Implement `ScaleWithWesley` Branding:** Integrate logo, favicon, and potentially updated color scheme/theme across the site.
2.  **Domain & Hosting Setup:** Ensure the site is correctly configured for the `scalewithwesley.com` domain on Vercel.
3.  **Rebrand/Enhance Blog:** Update blog styling for the brand. Ensure MDX features (code highlighting, etc.) are robust. (`TODO` related to item 10 in `NEW IDEA.MD`)
4.  **Setup Newsletter:** Implement frontend signup form component and backend `POST /api/newsletter/subscribe` endpoint. Integrate with chosen platform. (`TODO` related to items 8 & 9 in `NEW IDEA.MD`)
5.  **Develop Core Content:** Create initial blog posts for *functional* Seller Tools. (`TODO` related to item 11 in `NEW IDEA.MD`)
6.  **Promote Channels:** Add links to Social Media (once created) and Newsletter signup prominently. (`TODO` related to item 12 in `NEW IDEA.MD`)
7.  **Continue Core Tool Development:** Progress on high-priority tool enhancements from `TODO.md` (IDs 5, 6, 24, 28, 29) to make them functional for blog content and core value proposition.

**Future Phases (Phase 2 & 3):**

-   Further Tool Development & Content Expansion.
-   Audience Engagement (Social Media, Newsletter).
-   Advanced Integrations (e.g., LinkedIn - purpose-driven).
-   Other APIs (e.g., Contact Form, User Preferences - feature-driven).
-   Advanced Features (Auth, Analytics, etc. - refer to `TODO.md` and `NEW IDEA.MD`).

## 5. Coding & Design Standards

### 5.1. Core Principles

- **Consistency:** Uniform visual style (aligned with `ScaleWithWesley` brand), coding patterns, architecture.
- **Readability:** Clear, concise, well-documented code. Maintainability is key.
- **Modularity:** Small, focused, reusable components and functions.
- **Performance:** Optimize bundle size, runtime speed, Core Web Vitals.
- **Accessibility:** Adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines. Test with screen readers/keyboard navigation.
- **Branding:** Consistently apply the `ScaleWithWesley` logo, color palette, and typography across the UI.

### 5.2. Technical Stack & Implementation

- **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router). Use Server Components by default. Use Client Components (`'use client'`) judiciously.
- **Language:** TypeScript (Strict Mode). Use clear types/interfaces. Define shared types in `/lib` or co-locate.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS. Utilize `tailwind.config.ts`. Implement dark mode consistently.
- **UI Components:** Use `shadcn/ui` as base. Build custom reusable components in `/components`.
- **Icons:** Use `lucide-react`. Optimize custom SVGs.
- **State Management:** Prefer React hooks. Use server-side data fetching. Avoid complex client-side global state unless essential.
- **Data Fetching:** Use App Router patterns (async Server Components, Route Handlers). Implement loading/error states. Use Next.js fetch cache and Route Handler caching appropriately.
- **API Routes:** Use Next.js Route Handlers (`app/api/...`) for backend endpoints (e.g., newsletter signup). Implement proper request validation and error handling.
- **Content:** Use MDX for blog posts (`/content`). Ensure proper frontmatter, code highlighting, and component integration.
- **Images:** Use Next.js `<Image>`. Provide `alt`, `width`, `height`. Optimize assets.

### 5.3. Quality Standards

- **Error Handling:** Robust handling for API calls, user inputs, component rendering (Error Boundaries). User-friendly feedback.
- **Testing:** Unit tests for critical utils/logic (`/lib`). Integration tests for key features/flows. (Track via `TODO.md`).
- **Linting & Formatting:** Strictly adhere to ESLint/Prettier. Run `pnpm run check:all` before committing.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Test on modern Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge.
- **Performance Audits:** Regularly use Lighthouse. Aim for high scores.
