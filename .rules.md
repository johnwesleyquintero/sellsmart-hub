## 1. Introduction & Project Vision

### 1.1. Purpose

This document outlines the development standards, guidelines, project structure, and operational procedures for the Wesley Quintero Portfolio project. Adherence to these guidelines ensures code quality, consistency, and efficient collaboration.

### 1.2. Project Goal

To develop and maintain a modern, responsive portfolio website showcasing skills, projects, and professional experience, featuring a sophisticated suite of data-driven Amazon Seller Tools.

### 1.3. Strategic Objective

Streamline the workflow for Amazon sellers and brand managers by providing advanced algorithmic utilities that adhere to Amazon's standards. The aim is to reduce reliance on manual data analysis (e.g., in spreadsheets) and deliver robust, reliable, and exportable insights, positioning the tools ahead of existing SaaS offerings.

---

## 2. Development Environment & Setup

### 2.1. Package Manager

This project utilizes **npm** as the primary package manager and runtime.

- **Installation:** Ensure npm (version >= 8.0.0 recommended) is installed globally or available in your environment.
- **Dependency Management:** Use `npm install`, `npm install <package>`, `npm uninstall <package>`.
- **Lockfile:** Commit the `package-lock.json` file to version control to ensure deterministic installs.

### 2.2. Environment Variables

- Configure local environment variables by copying `.env.example` to `.env`.
- **Never commit `.env` files containing sensitive credentials.**
- Use `npm run env:pull` (if configured) to sync environment variables from a secure source.

### 2.3. npm Configuration Quality Checks

Run quality checks periodically or in CI pipelines to:

- Verify npm version compatibility.
- Ensure the integrity of `package-lock.json`.
- Validate that `package.json` scripts are compatible with and optimized for npm.
- Check npm's module resolution behavior against project expectations.

---

## 3. Project Structure

The project follows a standard Next.js 14 App Router structure, organized for clarity and maintainability.

### 3.1. Directory Structure

- `app/`: Contains the main application code.
  - `components/`: Reusable UI components.
  - `data/`: Data fetching and processing logic.
  - `lib/`: Utility functions and helpers.
  - `pages/`: Next.js page components.
  - `styles/`: CSS and styling files.
- `public/`: Static assets like images, fonts, etc.
- `server/`: Server-side code (if applicable).
- `types/`: TypeScript type definitions.
- `scripts/`: Scripts for project setup, build, etc.
- `npm.lockb`: Dependency lockfile.
- `package.json`: Project configuration and dependencies.

### 3.2. File Naming Conventions

- **Component Files:** PascalCase (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx`).
- **Data Files:** kebab-case (e.g., `my-data.ts`).
- **Style Files:** kebab-case (e.g., `my-component.css`).

### 3.3. Code Organization

- **Modularity:** Components should be self-contained and modular.
- **Reusability:** Components should be easily reusable across different parts of the application.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Different parts of the application should be separated into different directories (e.g., `/components`, `/pages`, `/lib`).
- **TypeScript Typing:** Use TypeScript types to ensure type safety and improve code readability.

## 4. Development Workflow & Priorities

### 4.1. Version Control (Git)

- **Branching:** Follow GitHub Flow. Create feature branches from `main` (e.g., `feat/my-feature`, `fix/bug-description`).
- **Commits:**
  - Keep commits small, atomic, and focused on a single logical change.
  - Use Conventional Commit messages (`type(scope): description`). See Section 4.2 for details.
  - Ensure commits pass all pre-commit hooks or CI checks (linting, type-checking).
- **Pull Requests (PRs):**
  - Rebase feature branches onto the latest `main` before creating a PR.
  - Fill out the PR template thoroughly.
  - Ensure all CI checks pass.
  - Request reviews from maintainers.
  - Squash commits (optional, based on team preference) before merging for a cleaner history.
  - Delete branches after merging.

### 4.2. Git Commit Message Guidelines

**Format:** `type(scope): description`

**Common Types:**

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `refactor`: Code restructuring without changing functionality
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, whitespace)
- `docs`: Documentation changes only
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `build`: Changes affecting the build system or external dependencies
- `ci`: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- `chore`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files

**Project Scopes (Examples):**

- `core`: Core application logic, Next.js setup
- `blog`: Blog system, MDX content, related components
- `tools`: Amazon Seller Tools suite (can be more specific, e.g., `tools-acos`)
- `ui`: Shared UI components, styling, themes
- `lib`: Utility functions, hooks, types
- `deps`: Dependency updates
- `config`: Configuration files
- `docs`: Documentation files (`README`, `.rules.md`, etc.)

**Breaking Changes:**

- Append `!` after the scope (e.g., `refactor(api)!: ...`).
- Include a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer in the commit body explaining the change.

### 4.3. Current Priorities & Initiatives

#### 4.3.1. Code Cleanup & Optimization (Immediate Tasks)

- **Identify & Consolidate Duplicates:** Systematically review and remove redundant UI components and utility functions/files across the codebase.
- **Remove Unused Code:** Identify and safely remove unused UI components and utility functions.
- **Improve Code Readability:** Refactor critical sections of the codebase, particularly within the Seller Tools, to enhance clarity, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.

#### 4.3.2. Amazon Seller Tools Suite - Redesign & Refactor

Focus on elevating the user experience and technical foundation of the Seller Tools suite:

- **Enhanced Data Visualization:** Integrate interactive charts/graphs (e.g., using Recharts or similar) supporting drill-downs, customization, and potentially real-time updates.
- **Robust Data Export:** Implement comprehensive export functionality (CSV, Excel, PDF, JSON) with user-configurable options.
- **Intuitive Navigation & Information Architecture:** Redesign the tool navigation for clarity and ease of use. Ensure a consistent information hierarchy.
- **Responsive Design & Accessibility:** Ensure full responsiveness across devices and strict adherence to WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility guidelines.
- **Code Refactoring & Reusability:** Refactor tool-specific logic for better maintainability, scalability, and testability. Maximize the use of shared/reusable components and utilities from `/components/ui` and `/lib`.

**Next Steps:** Implement these improvements systematically across all tools, ensuring backward compatibility or clear migration paths where necessary. Prioritize based on impact and dependencies (refer to `TODO.md` for detailed task tracking).

## 5. Coding & Design Standards

### 5.1. Core Principles

- **Consistency:** Maintain a uniform visual style, coding pattern, and architectural approach throughout the application.
- **Readability:** Write clear, concise, and well-documented code. Prioritize maintainability.
- **Modularity:** Design components and functions to be small, focused, and reusable.
- **Performance:** Optimize for speed and efficiency (npmdle size, runtime performance, perceived performance).
- **Accessibility:** Design and build with accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) as a primary requirement.

### 5.2. Technical Stack & Implementation

- **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router). Leverage Server Components by default; use Client Components (`'use client'`) only when necessary (e.g., for hooks, event listeners).
- **Language:** TypeScript (Strict Mode enabled). Use clear, descriptive types and interfaces. Define shared types in `/lib`.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS. Utilize the project's theme configuration (`tailwind.config.ts`). Implement dark mode support consistently.
- **UI Components:** Primarily use `shadcn/ui` components for foundational elements. Build custom, reusable components in `/components`.
- **Icons:** Use `lucide-react` for consistency. Use custom SVGs only when necessary and ensure they are optimized.
- **State Management:** Prefer React hooks (`useState`, `useReducer`, `useContext`) for local/shared state. Use server-side data fetching (Server Components, Route Handlers) wherever possible. Avoid complex global client-side state managers unless strictly necessary.
- **Data Fetching:** Utilize Next.js App Router patterns (async Server Components, Route Handlers). Implement proper loading states and error handling. Consider caching strategies (Next.js fetch cache, Route Handler caching).
- **Images:** Use the Next.js `<Image>` component for optimization. Provide `alt` text, `width`, `height`, and consider `placeholder` props. Source images responsibly (e.g., Unsplash with proper attribution/licensing).

### 5.3. Quality Standards

- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for API calls, user inputs, and component rendering (e.g., Error Boundaries). Provide informative feedback to the user.
- **Testing:** Write unit tests for critical utility functions and business logic (`/lib`). Aim for integration tests for complex features or user flows. (Refer to `TODO.md` for specific testing tasks).
- **Linting & Formatting:** Adhere strictly to ESLint and Prettier rules configured in the project. Run `npm run lint` and `npm run prettier --write .` regularly.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Test on major modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- **Performance Audits:** Regularly audit performance using Lighthouse or similar tools. Aim for high scores, particularly on Core Web Vitals.
