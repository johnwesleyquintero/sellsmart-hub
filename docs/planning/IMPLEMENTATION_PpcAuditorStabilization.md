# Implementation Plan: PPC Campaign Auditor Stabilization

**Priority:** High (Task #3 from PRIORITY.txt)
**Date:** 2024-05-22
**Status:** Status Conflict / Potential Instability

## 1. Goal

Resolve the conflicting status information (Beta v0.9.0 vs. Active v2.0.0) for the PPC Campaign Auditor. If the tool is not yet stable or feature-complete for v2.0.0, identify and address all blocking issues to achieve a production-ready state.

## 2. Requirements

1.  **Clarify True Status:** Determine the actual stability, performance, and feature completeness of the current PPC Campaign Auditor implementation.
2.  **Identify Issues:** If not stable v2.0.0, perform thorough testing to identify specific bugs, performance bottlenecks, usability problems, or missing features intended for v2.0.0.
3.  **Fix Bugs:** Resolve any identified critical or major bugs affecting functionality (e.g., filtering, sorting, data display).
4.  **Address Performance:** Investigate and optimize any performance issues, especially with larger datasets if applicable.
5.  **Complete Features (if any):** Implement any essential features that were planned for v2.0.0 but are currently missing.
6.  **Final Testing:** Conduct regression testing and user acceptance testing (if possible) to confirm stability.
7.  **Update Documentation:** Correct the status and version information in `amazon-seller-tools.mdx` and any other relevant places to accurately reflect v2.0.0.

## 3. Proposed Solution/Approach

1.  **Assessment:**
    *   Review the existing codebase for `PpcCampaignAuditor.tsx`.
    *   Perform comprehensive manual testing covering all features: data loading (if applicable, e.g., via CSV or state), filtering options, column toggling, sorting by various columns. Test with edge cases and potentially large datasets.
    *   Document any bugs, unexpected behavior, slow performance, or usability issues found.
2.  **Issue Resolution:**
    *   Prioritize the documented issues (bugs > performance > minor usability).
    *   Debug and implement fixes for bugs.
    *   Use browser developer tools (Profiler, Performance monitor) to investigate performance bottlenecks and refactor code or optimize algorithms as needed.
    *   Implement any missing v2.0.0 features (if identified as necessary).
3.  **Verification:**
    *   Perform regression testing to ensure fixes didn't introduce new problems.
    *   Repeat the comprehensive manual testing from the assessment phase.
4.  **Documentation Update:**
    *   Once stable, update `amazon-seller-tools.mdx` to consistently show "âœ… Active" and "2.0.0". Remove the Beta note.

## 4. Key Components/Files

*   `src/components/tools/PpcCampaignAuditor.tsx` (Modify)
*   Related data handling, filtering, sorting logic (Modify)
*   `src/app/content/blog/amazon-seller-tools.mdx` (Update)

## 5. UI/UX Considerations

*   Ensure all interactive elements (filters, toggles, sort headers) are responsive and function correctly.
*   Verify data display is clear and accurate.

## 6. Data Handling

*   Confirm data loading, filtering, and sorting logic are robust and performant.

## 7. Error Handling

*   Ensure any potential errors (e.g., during data processing) are handled gracefully.

## 8. Testing Strategy

*   Comprehensive manual testing of all features.
*   Testing with varied datasets (small, large, edge cases).
*   Regression testing after fixes.
*   Performance profiling if slowdowns are observed.

## 9. Definition of Done

*   The true status of the tool is confirmed.
*   All critical/major bugs preventing a v2.0.0 release are fixed.
*   Performance is deemed acceptable.
*   The tool meets the agreed-upon criteria for v2.0.0.
*   Documentation is updated to reflect "Active" status and "2.0.0" version consistently.
*   The Beta v0.9.0 mention is removed.

## 10. Open Questions/Decisions

*   What specific issues (if any) are currently known or suspected? (Requires initial assessment step).
*   Were there specific features planned for v2.0.0 that might be missing?
