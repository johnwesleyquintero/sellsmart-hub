# Implementation Plan: Optimal Price Calculation Tool

**Priority:** High (Task #1 from PRIORITY.txt)
**Date:** 2024-05-22
**Status:** Not Started

## 1. Goal

Develop and integrate the "Optimal Price Calculation" tool, which is currently marked as 'under development and not yet available' in the documentation. This tool should help users determine a potentially optimal selling price for their product based on relevant inputs.

## 2. Requirements

- **Core Concept:** Define what "optimal" means in this context (e.g., maximizing profit, maximizing sales velocity, specific market positioning). This definition will drive the required inputs and calculation logic.
- **Input Method:** Manual input fields.
- **Required Inputs (Initial Proposal - Needs Significant Refinement):**
  - Product Cost (COGS)
  - Amazon Fees (Referral, FBA, Storage - potentially simplified or linked from FBA Calc?)
  - Target Profit Margin (%)
  - Competitor Prices (Min, Max, Average?)
  - Estimated Sales Velocity at different price points (Simple model or user input?)
  - Advertising Cost per Sale (Optional?)
  - _(Decision Needed: CRITICAL - Define the core calculation model and the necessary inputs based on the definition of "optimal")._
- **Calculation Logic:**
  - Implement the algorithm/model decided upon to calculate the suggested optimal price or price range. This is the most complex part and needs clear definition.
- **Output/Display:**
  - Display the suggested "Optimal Price" or range.
  - Show projected profit/margin at that price.
  - Potentially show sensitivity analysis (how profit changes with price).
- **Technology:**
  - React functional component with TypeScript.
  - State management using React Hooks (`useState`).
  - UI components from `shadcn/ui`.

## 3. Proposed Solution/Approach

1.  **Define Model:** **First, finalize the calculation model/strategy for determining "optimal price".** This is prerequisite for development.
2.  **Create Component:** Develop `src/components/tools/OptimalPriceCalculator.tsx`.
3.  **Define State:** Use `useState` for all required input values and calculated outputs (suggested price, projected profit).
4.  **Build UI:** Use `shadcn/ui` components (`Input`, `Label`, `Card`, `Button`, etc.) for inputs and displaying results.
5.  **Implement Logic:** Translate the defined pricing model into TypeScript functions within the component or helper files.
6.  **Integration:** Add the tool to navigation/routing and update documentation upon completion.

## 4. Key Components/Files

- `src/components/tools/OptimalPriceCalculator.tsx` (New)
- Potentially `src/lib/pricingUtils.ts` (New)
- Routing/Navigation files (Update)
- `src/app/content/blog/amazon-seller-tools.mdx` (Update upon completion)

## 5. UI/UX Considerations

- Clearly label all input fields.
- Explain the basis for the suggested price (if possible).
- Make the output (suggested price) prominent.

## 6. Data Handling

- Component state for inputs and outputs.
- Input validation (numeric fields, percentages).

## 7. Error Handling

- Input validation messages.
- Handle cases where calculation is not possible (e.g., missing critical inputs).

## 8. Testing Strategy

- Manual testing with various input scenarios.
- Verification of calculation logic against predefined examples or the model specification.

## 9. Definition of Done

- Calculation model defined and approved.
- Tool component created and functional based on the defined model.
- Accepts required inputs.
- Calculates and displays the suggested optimal price and related metrics.
- Tool integrated into the application.

## 10. Open Questions/Decisions

- **Primary:** What is the model/algorithm for calculating the "optimal price"?
- What specific inputs are required for this model?
- How should Amazon fees be handled (manual input, estimated, linked)?
